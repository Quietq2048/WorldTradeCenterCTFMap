this link are my sources for near accuracy of the WTC Map project dated 1976-2002
the map took me 9 months to complete

this is the link to the blueprints of the north tower of the world trade center.


This map was made solely based as a rememberance of an important gem in the New York Skyline, the impacts and benifits it gained such as increasing foreign trade, much needed corporate offices due to the Digital revolution and the revenue made off the trade floor in the 4WTC.
The World Trade Center building 7 is not featured on this map due to the already huge size of the map and the unknowness of the purpouse of the structure (mainly goverment offices). there was a pedestrian walkway that connected 6WTC to the World Financial Center but i replaced the spot with the red flag base.
A trident is featured on the corner of the map where the WFC is supposed to be, and this is just a memorial of those who lost their lives in the September 11th attacks. I highly condemn any jokes involving aircraft being purpousely flown into the buildings. The 3WTC (HYATT) hotel was a hotel for corporate meetings, trade shows, and social events. The underground of the WTC featured a mall and a transit hub, however i left it empty with the occasional chest due to how large the map is already. 

 This map might actually be big enough to feature 4 teams, if anyone wants to add 2 more teams on it, go for it!
